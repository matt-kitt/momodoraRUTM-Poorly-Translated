# momodoraRUTM-Poorly-Translated
The text in Momodora:RUTM has been run through many different languages, then back to English, providing an intriguing and sometimes laughable result.

**!Notice!**
Make sure to back up your old language files first. If you forget, I have provided the original English file: "vanilla_sentences.msf". Just rename it to "sentences.msf" first.

*How to install:*
Replace the language file of your choice with the provided sentences.msf

*Where?*
Find the local files for your installation of Momodora:RUTM

Ex. (Steam):
1. Click on "Manage" on the game's page
2. Hover over "Manage    >"
3. Click on "Browse local files"
4. Open the "language" folder
5. Open a subfolder of your choice (en = english), and replace the sentences.msf within with the provided one.
6. Enjoy!

This "mod" has not been extensively tested. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ping me on the official Momodora Discord server, or DM me, at _NoneYa_#8994.

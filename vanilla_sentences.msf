intro_npc_dia1 I'm afraid this is as far as#I can take you.
intro_npc_dia2 I'm sorry.|||||||||||||||||#Anything close to the city#is too dangerous.
intro_npc_dia3 Surely,|||||||||||||||| that shouldn't be a problem#for a priestess like you.
intro_npc_dia4 Fighting using a leaf#must be difficult...
intro_npc_dia5 But I have faith in your ability to#seal the curse away.
intro_npc_dia6 It has spread to your land too,||||||||||||||||||||||#after all.
intro_npc_dia7 For now, maybe the best you can do#is seek an audience with our Queen.

cath01_dia01 What are you looking at?#||||||||||I'm human,|||||||||||| like you.
cath01_dia02 You don't seem very capable#of protecting yourself.
cath01_dia03 Take my word and look#for shelter.
cath01_dia04 |||||||||My name is Cath.#||||||||||||||||I'm a knightess in service#of the kingdom.
cath01_dia05 So, you are a priestess from Lun.#||||||||||||And you're seeking the Queen's aid?
cath01_dia06 ||||Ha.#||||Ha.#|||||||Ha.
cath01_dia07 You think she has any interest#in your little village?
cath01_dia08 ||||||||||||Well,||||||||||| here's some bad news.
cath01_dia09 |||||||||||||||I've heard rumors of an undead witch#lurking around...
cath01_dia10 |||||||||Progressing deeper into the city#is very risky.
cath01_dia11 ||||||||||||If you are adamant about meeting#with the Queen,||||||||||||||| my advice only goes#so far.
cath01_dia12 No one wants to be in#this forsaken city any longer.
cath01_dia13 Our entire kingdom feels like a grave.#||||||||||||||||The death count keeps going up#daily.
cath01_dia14 ||||||||||I don't have much left other#than the memory of my#sister,||||||||||||||| Cathryn.

cath02_dia01 Thank you for your assistance.#Are you hurt?
cath02_dia02 Since you're still around,||||||||||||| perhaps#you'll hear me out.
cath02_dia03 You damn roach.|||||||||||||#I'm not wasting my time#with you!
cath02_dia04 Good.
cath02_dia05 I've suspected something was amiss#up there at the castle.
cath02_dia06 The Queen I once served was noble and#caring,||||||||||||| but now she's turned into a#morbid figure.
cath02_dia07 Anything under her direct control is lost,|||||||||||||||||#so I've deserted her order of knights.
cath02_dia08 Here's my proposal:||||||||||||#taking down the Queen.
cath02_dia09 You mentioned her curse has#reached your homeland.
cath02_dia10 Should you choose to side with me,|||||||||||#you're going to need a special crest.
cath02_dia11 It was split into four pieces.#One of its fragments should be#around here...
cath02_dia12 It seems we don't have#many alternatives.
cath02_dia13 We have to behead the#lovely Queen.
cath02_dia14 S-say,|||||||||||| maybe we should hang out#more once all of this is done...
cath02_dia15 Argh!
cath02_dia16 It's my first time seeing a sacred#leaf in action.
cath02_dia17 Certainly an interesting way of#fending off enemies...
cath02_dia18 Once you have the four parts,|||||||||||||||||||#head to the locked door at the#entrance of the city. 

cath03_dia01 @£K...£ |||||||||||||||Kaho...

cath03_dia05 £@...

citynpc01_dia01 I'm not scared.
citynpc01_dia02 The royal court has been ignoring us#citizens ever since this kingdom#fell to a curse.
citynpc01_dia03 If you want to stay safe,||||||||||||||#don't leave outside.
citynpc01_dia04 @£Make this stop...

church_dia01 A neophyte?#|||||Do you seek salvation?
church_dia02 You can achieve salvation from eternal#damnation by donating to Saint#Esselin.
church_dia03 A recommendation of at least 15 munnies#is needed for that.
church_dia04 We are thankful.#May you find peace.
church_dia05 You do not have the minimum#value we require.
church_dia06 May the Lord have#mercy on you.
church_dia07 -Personnel Only-
church_dia08 ...
church_dia09 We are a small minority now#that the Her Highness propagated her#destruction.
church_dia10 Most of the population has#lost faith in the gods...
church_dia11 She's to blame for all#that is wrong right now.
church_dia12 Saint Esselin is absolute.#His wish reigns supreme.
church_dia13 You are safe here with us.

choir_dia01 Our prayers have been heard.||||||||||||||||#The Witch of Decay and her#demons have been vanquished.
choir_dia02 Little by little,|||||||||||||||||||| the voice of the#gods pierces through this kingdom#shrouded in darkness.
choir_dia03 Still,||||||||||||| for this convent to go#against Her Highness' wishes...#It is a disgrace to the name of our lord.
choir_dia04 Her kindness knows no bounds.#||||||||||||||If you so desire,||||||||||||||||||| she'll protect even a#heretic from Lun such as you.
choir_dia05 Under the sacred protection of our Lord,#||||||||let us pray for the souls of those departed,#||||||||||||||and for those wasted by the dark.
choir_dia06 @Please,||||||||||||||| my Lord,||||||||||||| have mercy#on the soul of my poor sister.#||||||||||||||||||So she can rest in peace...
choir_dia07 That tissue you possess...
choir_dia08 It certainly belonged to#my younger sister.
choir_dia09 Would you be willing to#give it to me?
choir_dia10 Handed in the Soft Tissue.
choir_dia11 Thank you for your kindness.
choir_dia12 Like my deceased sister,#|||||||||||||||you pose a threat to the Crown.
choir_dia13 I can't idle around when you do#as you please.||||||||||||||||#Pray your soul will go in peace.
choir_dia14 Lord Esselin,|||||||||||||||||#have mercy on me...

fennel_dia01 £@Why...?#|||||||||||||||||||My Lord...
fennel_dia02 The Queen destroyed this#kingdom's faith.
fennel_dia03 This convent,|||||||||| our abode,||||||||||#is all that's left for those#who pray.
fennel_dia04 Maiden in white...#|||||||||||||You are not one of us.
fennel_dia05 Perhaps you are siding#with the Queen?
fennel_dia06 Look at what she's done#to this kingdom!
fennel_dia07 It is my duty to#expurge that evil!

moka01_dia01 Huh?
moka01_dia02 ||||||||Looks like some#outsider missionary...
moka01_dia03 @Ke he he...
moka01_dia04 Ah ha ha...#|||||||||||||Your rotten corpse will#serve my mistress well!
moka01_dia05 £You little pest...
moka01_dia06 £I can't waste any more time#with you!
moka02_dia01 No...|||||||||||||||||#No!
moka02_dia02 £NO...! ||||||||||||||||NO! ||||||||#NONONONO!!!

paramol_dia01 Don't come any closer.
paramol_dia02 Oh well.||||||||#You seem sane enough.
paramol_dia03 You are a priestess seeking an#audience with the royal court?
paramol_dia04 In the present state,|||||||||||| reaching#the castle is highly difficult.
paramol_dia05 You won't find help easily in#this city,||||||||||||| but...
paramol_dia06 My Master might be able#to guide you.
paramol_dia07 She lives inside this city's#monastery, surrounded by cats.
paramol_dia08 Have you seen the people#of this city?||||||||||||#Everything is lost.
paramol_dia09 Fear destroys our minds.|||||||||||#Stay safe.
paramol_dia10 Have you heard?#|||||||||||||||||||The pardoner's older sibling#has returned.
paramol_dia11 She is one of the court authorities#on behalf of the convent.
paramol_dia12 Perhaps you'll be#interested in meeting her.

cotti_dia01 If it isn't an unfamiliar face#to this monastery.
cotti_dia02 A devout from Lun,|||||||||||| I see. #||||||||||||You can call me Cotillard.
cotti_dia03 Oh?#||||||||||You have met with Paramol?
cotti_dia04 Ke ke ke...#|||||||||||||Such innocence.
cotti_dia05 So,|||||||||||||||||| you are concerned about your homeland.#||||||||||Indeed, the darkness assaulting your people#hails from here.
cotti_dia06 |||||||Our Queen has become possessed#by a malevolent greed.|||||||||||||
cotti_dia07 She's the one responsible for many casualties.|||||||||||||#Not only here, but in other lands,|||||||||||| too.
cotti_dia08 @Ke ke ke...@
cotti_dia09 Perhaps you should head to the castle.|||||||||||||||#Just don't expect kindness from#those who live there.
cotti_dia10 You'll have to find the#way on your own.
cotti_dia11 Here,||||||||||||||| this should help you a bit.
cotti_dia12 Be careful.||||||||||||||||#It's been only a year since all#of this started,|||||||||||||| but most of our#population is completely degenerated.
cotti_dia13 This area has been declared forbidden by#the nobility,||||||||||| so it's refreshing to see#an outsider.
cotti_dia14 I see you've made some progress.||||||||||||||||||#Heading to the castle,|||||||||||||||||||| still?
cotti_dia15 @The source of this mess,|||||||||||||||||#ke ke ke...
cotti_dia16 When Her Highness made a contract#with the Underworld,||||||||||||||||||||||| certainly she did not#expect this outcome.
cotti_dia17 Or did she?
cotti_dia18 I hope for the success of your#endeavors,|||||||||||||||||| maiden from Lun.
cotti_dia19 Face the loyalty that remains,||||||||||||||||#if it has not turned to fear yet.
cotti_dia20 Ke ke...#|||What an adorable little cat you are.

eri01_dia01 Finally out of the cell...
eri01_dia02 It should be safe here.#This place seems completely#abandoned.
eri01_dia03 Now...#||||||||||||||Which way is the forest again...?
eri01_dia04 H-£Huh.
eri01_dia05 @What's with those clothes...?||||||||||||||#@Who are you?!#Identify yourself,|||||||||||||| now!
eri01_dia06 Priestess?#Okay, then.
eri01_dia07 Here's a friendly warning: you won't#find safety in this region anymore.
eri01_dia08 According to hearsay,||||||||||||||| the Queen summoned#a storm of disease from her castle,||||||||||||||||||||| one that's#spreading throughout the world...
eri01_dia09 Look,|||||||||||||||| you don't seem like#a bad person.
eri01_dia10 Please run away from here and save#yourself while you still can.

eri02_dia01 I'm glad you are#still alive.
eri02_dia02 I guess I didn't introduce#myself last time.
eri02_dia03 My name is Eri.#|||||||||||||||Nice to meet you.
eri02_dia04 So,|||||||||||||||| you came here#from the west.
eri02_dia05 Hmm.||||||||||||#Anywhere would be safer than here.|||||||||||||||||#This city is...
eri02_dia06 Our people...|||||||||||||||||||#Have become shapeless,||||||||||||| aimless#ghosts.
eri02_dia07 We were left here to die,||||||||||||||#don't you think?
eri02_dia08 I...|||||||||||||||||#You are right.
eri02_dia09 Ah... Thank you.#|||||#Your words give me hope.
eri02_dia10 I'm retreating to the bordering#forest.||||||||||||||||||| That area is protected from#the Queen's curse.

eri03_dia01 Ah,||||||||||||| how is it going?
eri03_dia02 I see.#You've come from far away,||||||||||||| and even#your homeland is being affected by our curse...
eri03_dia03 Hey!#£That Hazel Badge!£
eri03_dia04 I wonder if you'd be willing to trade it#for this special item I possess?

eri03_dia09 I'm sorry...

florist_dia01 Ah... Hello.#How may I help you?
florist_dia02 You may have noticed parts of#the city have been affected by a foul curse.
florist_dia03 This area in particular has been displaced,#and is now corrupted by the spirits of the dead.
florist_dia04 @And so my dear plants have dried#to this souless form.@
florist_dia05 I've been looking for this rare insect#species,||||||||||||||||| a kind of Ivory Bug.
florist_dia06 If you happen to come across one of those,#|||||||||||||||please bring it to me!#I will reward you any way I can.

// Good ending
ending_dia03 When the curse from east reached the#village of Lun,|||||||||||||||||||||| a priestess was sent#on a sacred mission to seal it away.
ending_dia04 The priestess triumphed over the dark,||||||||||||||||| stopping#the spread of the curse by drawing it into her#body,||||||||||||||||||| but she faded away in the process.
ending_dia05 Now only a faint memory of her story#remains,||||||||||||||||||||||||||| passed on as tradition.
ending_dia06 Even so,|||||||||||||||||| her spirit of determination lingers on,#|||||||||||||||||||guiding younger priestesses towards finding peace.
